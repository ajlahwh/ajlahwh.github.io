# About me

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Neurosciences Graduate Program, working with [Dr. Marcelo Mattar](https://www.mattarlab.com/people) and [Dr. Marcus Benna](https://bennalab.biosci.ucsd.edu/people/) at University of California San Diego. 
I am interested in the intersection of AI and neuroscience. 

I am currently working on: (1) automatic discovery of cognitive strategies from behavior; (2) backpropagation in the biological brain; (3) representational geometry of decision-making; (4) interpretability of large language models.

In parallel, I am a Research Scientist Intern at Meta (Reality Labs, EMG Foundation Team), where I develop error attribution analysis for multi-model AI systems.

Prior to my PhD, I worked with [Dr. Stefano Fusi](https://ctn.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/people/stefano-fusi) and [Dr. Guangyu Robert Yang](https://www.metaconscious.org/people/) at Columbia University, with [Dr. Xiao-Jing Wang](https://www.cns.nyu.edu/wanglab/) at New York University, and with 
[Dr. Xiaochu Zhang](http://en.hfnl.ustc.edu.cn/Faculty/Facultys/201107/t20110716_116215.html) at [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) (as part of my [M.S. in Applied Statistics](http://en.business.ustc.edu.cn/audsf/list.htm)).

Before that, I graduated with [B.S. in Biological Science](https://en.biox.ustc.edu.cn/) and [B.E. in Computer Science and Technology](https://en.cs.ustc.edu.cn/) from [USTC](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/).

My work has been published in Nature, Nature Human Behaviour, iScience, Physical Review Applied, Human Brain Mapping, and at conferences such as NeurIPS, Cosyne, and CogSci. I have also served as a reviewer for eLife, Science Advances, NeurIPS, ICLR, and other journals & conferences.
