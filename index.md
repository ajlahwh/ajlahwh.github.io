# About me

I am a second-year PhD student in the Neurosciences Graduate Program. He is interested in neural computation of reinforcement learning and back propagation in the biological brain. He is currently co-advised by Dr. Marcelo Mattar.

My research now focuses on building computational models for memory, perception, reinforcement learning, and decision making at synaptic, circuit, cognitive, and behavioral levels. My works lay in the field of computational neuroscience and computational cognitive science, using tools from statistics, physics, machine learning, deep learning and other relevant fields.

Before that, I graduated with [M.S. in Applied Statistics](http://en.business.ustc.edu.cn/audsf/list.htm) from [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Dr. Yaning Yang](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~ynyang/) and [Dr. Xiaochu Zhang](http://en.hfnl.ustc.edu.cn/Faculty/Facultys/201107/t20110716_116215.html). 

Before that, I graduated with [B.S. in Biological Science](https://en.biox.ustc.edu.cn/) and [B.E. in Computer Science and Technology](https://en.cs.ustc.edu.cn/) from [USTC](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Dr. Xiaochu Zhang](http://en.hfnl.ustc.edu.cn/Faculty/Facultys/201107/t20110716_116215.html) and [Dr. Shangfei Wang](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~sfwang/).
