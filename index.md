# Short Biography

I am Ji-An Li (Jian Li, 李济安), graduating with a [Master of Applied Statistics](http://en.business.ustc.edu.cn/audsf/list.htm) from [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Yaning Yang](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~ynyang/) and [Prof. Xiaochu Zhang](http://en.hfnl.ustc.edu.cn/Faculty/Facultys/201107/t20110716_116215.html). Prior to that, I received my bachelor degree in [Life Sciences](https://en.biox.ustc.edu.cn/) and in [Computer Science](https://en.cs.ustc.edu.cn/) from [USTC](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Xiaochu Zhang](http://en.hfnl.ustc.edu.cn/Faculty/Facultys/201107/t20110716_116215.html) and [Prof. Shangfei Wang](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~sfwang/).

My research now focuses on building computational models for memory, perception, reinforcement learning, and decision making at synaptic, circuit, cognitive, and behavioral levels. My works lay in the field of computational neuroscience and computational cognitive science, using tools from statistics, physics, machine learning, deep learning and other relevant fields.
