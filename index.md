# About me

I am a second-year PhD student in the Neurosciences Graduate Program, working with [Dr. Marcelo Mattar](https://mattarlab.ucsd.edu/people) and [Dr. Marcus Benna](https://bennalab.biosci.ucsd.edu/people/) at University of California San Diego. I am generally interested in the fields of computational neuroscience and computational cognitive science. My research currently focuses on neural computations of reinforcement learning and back propagation in the biological brain, using tools from statistics, physics, machine learning, and data science.

Prior to my PhD, I worked with [Dr. Stefano Fusi](https://ctn.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/people/stefano-fusi) and [Dr. Guangyu Robert Yang](https://www.metaconscious.org/people/) at Columbia University, with [Dr. Xiao-Jing Wang](https://www.cns.nyu.edu/wanglab/) at New York University, and with 
[Dr. Xiaochu Zhang](http://en.hfnl.ustc.edu.cn/Faculty/Facultys/201107/t20110716_116215.html) at [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) (as part of my [M.S. in Applied Statistics](http://en.business.ustc.edu.cn/audsf/list.htm)).

Before that, I graduated with [B.S. in Biological Science](https://en.biox.ustc.edu.cn/) and [B.E. in Computer Science and Technology](https://en.cs.ustc.edu.cn/) from [USTC](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/).
