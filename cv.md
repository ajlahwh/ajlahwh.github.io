## Research 

Department of Neurosciences, UC San Diego

Advisor: Marcelo Mattar, Marcus Benna 2020 – Present

Discriminating Behavioral Algorithms with Neural Data

Developed a mathematical method (dynamical consistency analysis) that formalizes and measures the mapping between the behavioral algorithms and the neural dynamics, enabling the discrimination of behavioral models based on their dynamical consistency with neural activity. 

School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China

Advisor: Xiaochu Zhang 2015 – 2020

Quantum Reinforcement Learning during Human Decision Making

Showed that quantum reinforcement learning, a mathematical formalism inspired by quantum probability theory, can model human value-based decision making. Discovered the representation of unique quantum-like variables in the medial frontal gyrus with model-based fMRI analysis. (Graduate thesis)

Hierarchical Bayesian Models for the Iowa Gambling Task

Undergraduate thesis for Bachelor of Science in Biological Science (Outstanding Undergraduate thesis of USTC).

Zuckerman Institute, Columbia University

Advisor: Stefano Fusi 2018 – 2020

Face Familiarity Detection with Complex Synapses

Developed a modular face familiarity detection neural system with plastic complex synapses, serving as a feasible biological model for the brain’s hippocampo-cortical circuits.

Advisor: Guangyu Robert Yang 2018 – 2020

Understanding the Functional and Structural Differences across Excitatory and Inhibitory Neurons

Developed the convolutional recurrent neural networks equipped with excitatory and inhibitory neurons, serving as a model for the visual cortex. Explored
the necessary conditions for the networks to develop distinct selectivity and connectivity across cell types.

Center for Neural Science, New York University

Advisor: Xiao-Jing Wang 2017

Recurrent Neural Networks with Interneurons and Dendrites Performing Decision Making

Developed a neuronal circuit model of three types of interneurons and multi-compartmental pyramidal cells using recurrent neural networks. Studied the sensory gating mechanisms of the network performing a context-dependent decision-making task.
