## Research Experiences

### Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at the Microscale, USTC
Research Assistant (Advisor: Prof. Xiaochu Zhang)	Sep. 2015 – present

Project: Quantum Reinforcement Learning during Human Decision Making

Showed that quantum reinforcement learning, a mathematical formalism inspired by quantum probability theory, can model human value-based decision making. Discovered the representation of unique quantum-like variables in the medial frontal gyrus with model-based fMRI analysis. Graduate thesis. (Paper accepted by Nature Human Behaviour, as the first author)

Project: Computational Models for the Iowa Gambling Task with Hierarchical Bayesian Analysis

Undergraduate thesis for Bachelor of Science in Biological Science (awarded Outstanding Undergraduate Thesis of USTC).

Project: EEG-based Neurofeedback for Addiction Treatment

Undergraduate thesis for Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Technology.

### Zuckerman Institute, Columbia University

Staff Associate (Advisor: Prof. Stefano Fusi and Dr. Guangyu Robert Yang)	Jul. 2018 – Mar. 2019

Project: Face Familiarity Detection with Complex Synapses

Developed a modular face familiarity detection neural system with plastic complex synapses, serving as a feasible biological model for the brain’s hippocampo-cortical circuits. (Paper targeted to the Journal of Neuroscience, as the first author)

Project: Understanding the Functional and Structural Differences across Excitatory and Inhibitory Neurons

Developed the convolutional recurrent neural networks equipped with excitatory and inhibitory neurons, serving as a model for the visual cortex. Explored the necessary conditions for the networks to develop distinct selectivity and connectivity across cell types. (Paper submitted to the ICLR 2020, as the co-first author)

### Center for Neural Science, New York University

Assistant Research Scientist (Advisor: Prof. Xiao-Jing Wang)	Jun. 2017 – Sep. 2017

Project: Mechanisms of Recurrent Neural Networks with Interneurons and Dendrites Performing Decision Making

Developed a neuronal circuit model of three types of interneurons and multi-compartmental pyramidal cells using recurrent neural networks. Studied the sensory gating mechanisms of the network performing a context-dependent decision-making task. (Presented at SfN Neuroscience 2018, as the first author)
